# Backend

## npm script plan

- `dev`: run the backend in development mode (e.g., `nodemon src/index.js`) so code changes restart the server automatically.
- `start`: launch the production server (running compiled code) once the app is ready for release.
- `lint`: execute ESLint across the backend sources to catch syntax and style issues before commits.
